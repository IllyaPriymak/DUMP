          [Intro]
You used to call me on my <br>
You used to, you used to <br>
Yeah <br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
Call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
And I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1] <br>
Ever since I left the city, you <br>
Got a reputation for yourself now <br>
Everybody knows and I feel left out Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out ‘Cause ever since I left the city, you <br>
 Started wearing less and goin' out more <br>
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor <br>
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before <br>
 <br>
[Chorus] <br>
You used to call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
Call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you <br>
You and me, we just don't get along <br>
You make me feel like I did you wrong <br>
Going places where you don't belong <br>
Ever since I left the city, you <br>
You got exactly what you asked for <br>
Running out of pages in your passport Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before <br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
Call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
And I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
These days, all I do is <br>
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else <br>
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else <br>
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else <br>
You don't need no one else <br>
You don't need nobody else, no <br>
Why you never alone? <br>
Why you always touching road? <br>
Used to always stay at home Be a good girl, you was in the zone <br>
 Yeah, you should just be yourself <br>
  Right now, you're someone else <br>
 <br>
[Chorus]<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
Call me on my cell phone <br>
Late night when you need my love <br>
And I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
I know when that hotline bling <br>
That can only mean one thing <br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
Ever since I left the city…
