          [Verse 1] <br>
My guy pretty like a girl <br>
And he got fight stories to tell <br>
I see both sides like Chanel <br>
See on both sides like Chanel <br>
Swimmin' laps through pool water <br>
Heated like I'm underworld <br>
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya <br>
Police think I'm of the underworld <br>
12 treat a nigga like he twelve <br>
How you lookin' up to me and talkin' down? (Yeah) <br>
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man) <br>
God level, I am the I am (Woah) <br>
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam <br>
Put a zoom on that stick, No√©, up so close I'm on that kill <br>
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good <br>
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull <br>
Rollin' when you ride, poppin' <br>
Rollin' when you ride, ride the Rodman <br>
Got one that's straight actin' <br>
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride) <br>
2016: burnt some discs (Dope) <br>
2017: ideas playin' off a Walkman <br>
This a cult, not a clique on the net <br>
With a cup in a cup, Actavis <br>
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife) <br>
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fightin' (Fightin') <br>
Revenge in the air make my lungs sick <br>
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah) <br>
Clips on clips like Mike (Hello) <br>
It's really all <br>
 <br>
[Chorus] <br>
I see both sides like Chanel <br>
See on both sides like Chanel <br>
 <br>
[Bridge] <br>
It's really you on my mind <br>
It's really you on my mind <br>
It's really you <br>
It's really you on my mind <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2] <br>
V both sides of the 12 <br>
Steam both sides of the L <br>
Freeze smoke rings and they hail <br>
Sleet snow grind for the wealth <br>
Whole team diamonds is real <br>
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves <br>
You need a cosign for your health <br>
I need that bitch to grind on my belt <br>
I know you need to try for my belt <br>
I know you seen it drivin' itself <br>
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale <br>
But it's stealth <br>
 <br>
[Chorus] <br>
I see both sides like Chanel <br>
I see both sides like Chanel <br>
 <br>
[Outro] <br>
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7 <br>
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards <br>
I got new money, and it's all cash <br>
I got new bags, and they all collabs <br>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards <br>
(I mean my baby bi) <br>
Amazing, the cash online unknown <br>
(I mean my baby bi) <br>
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home <br>
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7 <br>
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards <br>
I got new money, and it's all cash <br>
I got new bags, and they all collabs <br>
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards (I mean my baby bi) <br>
Amazing, the cash online unknown (I mean my baby bi) <br>
Blazin' the dash, countin' money at home <br>
