          [Chorus] <br>
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again <br>
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! <br>
Things I don't understand <br>
Sometimes I need to be alone <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
I can feel your energy from two planets away <br>
I got my drink, I got my music <br>
I would share it, but today I'm yelling <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1] <br>
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich <br>
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist <br>
I can feel the changes <br>
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous <br>
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless <br>
You don't know what pain is <br>
How can I paint this picture <br>
When the color blind is hangin' with you? <br>
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar <br>
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart <br>
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick <br>
I can admit that it did look like yours <br>
Why you resent every making of this? <br>
Tell me your purpose is petty again <br>
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge <br>
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge <br>
 <br>
[Refrain] <br>
I can feel the changes <br>
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous <br>
You can see that my city found me <br>
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' <br>
To you that's a quick check <br>
With all disrespect, let me say this <br>
 <br>
[Chorus] <br>
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again <br>
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! <br>
Things I don't understand <br>
Sometimes I need to be alone <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
I can feel your energy from two planets away <br>
I got my drink, I got my music <br>
I would share it, but today I'm yelling <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2] <br>
I'm tryin' to keep it alive <br>
And not compromise the feeling we love <br>
You're tryin' to keep it deprived <br>
And only co-sign what radio does <br>
And I'm lookin' right past you <br>
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles <br>
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror <br>
I know what you scared of <br>
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior <br>
This shit is vital, I know you had to <br>
This shit is vital, I know you had to <br>
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain <br>
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain <br>
Rather a seasonal name <br>
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame <br>
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box <br>
I'ma break out and then hide every lock <br>
I'ma break out and then hide every lock <br>
 <br>
[Refrain] <br>
I can feel the changes <br>
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous <br>
You can see that my city found me <br>
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin' <br>
To you that's a quick check <br>
With all disrespect, let me say this <br>
 <br>
[Chorus] <br>
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again <br>
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me! <br>
Things I don't understand <br>
Sometimes I need to be alone <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
I can feel your energy from two planets away <br>
I got my drink, I got my music <br>
I would share it, but today I'm yelling <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
 <br>
[Outro] <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time <br>
Don't you see that long line? <br>
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth <br>
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync <br>
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings <br>
Now what you better do <br>
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive <br>
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution <br>
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music <br>
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe! <br>
 <br>
[Death to Molly] <br>
 <br>
[Outro] <br>
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga! <br>
Come on, we finna roll out! <br>
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD <br>
Get yo' freestyles ready! <br>
