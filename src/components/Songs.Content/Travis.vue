          [Intro: Travis Scott] <br>
Yeah <br>
7:30 in the night, yeah <br>
Ooh-oooh, ooh <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Travis Scott] <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah <br>
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine <br>
Worried 'bout those comments <br>
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich <br>
Throw that to the side, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah <br>
When you're not around (Straight up) <br>
When you throw that to the side, yeah (It's lit) <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: Travis Scott] <br>
7-1-3 <br>
Through the 2-8-1, yeah, I'm ridin', why they on me? <br>
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key <br>
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider <br>
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya <br>
Pop star, lil' Mariah <br>
When I text a cute game, wildness <br>
Throw a stack on the Bible <br>
Never Snapchat or took molly <br>
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah <br>
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah <br>
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all <br>
Yeah, when I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong <br>
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed <br>
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you (Brr, brr, brr) <br>
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate <br>
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay <br>
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know <br>
Oh, back the fuck up off me (Brr, brr, brr) <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Travis Scott] <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah <br>
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine <br>
Worried 'bout those comments <br>
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich <br>
Throw that to the side, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah <br>
When you're not around <br>
When you throw that to the side, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] <br>
I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my <br>
I want a green light, I wanna be like <br>
I wanna press my line, yeah <br>
I wanna take that ride, yeah <br>
I'm gonna press my line <br>
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press myâ€” <br>
Mama, dear, spare your feelings <br>
I'm relivin' moments, peeling more residual <br>
(I can) buy the building, burn the building <br>
Take your bitch, rebuild the building just to fuck some more <br>
(I can) justify my love for you <br>
And touch the sky for God to stop, debating war <br>
Put the pussy on a pedestal (Ayy) <br>
Put the pussy on a high horse <br>
That pussy to die for <br>
That pussy to die for <br>
Peter, piper, picked a pepper <br>
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together <br>
We depart the shady parts and party hard <br>
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever <br>
My best shots might shoot forever like (Brr) <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Travis Scott] <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah <br>
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine <br>
Worried 'bout those comments <br>
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich <br>
Throw that to the side, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah <br>
When you're not around <br>
When you throw that to the side, yeah <br>
I get those goosebumps every time <br>
