[Intro: Rick James & James Brown <br>
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya <br>
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya <br>
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya <br>
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya <br>
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies-ladies and gentlemen <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Kanye West] <br>
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong <br>
You been putting up with my shit just way too long <br>
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most <br>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast <br>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags <br>
Let's have a toast for the assholes <br>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags <br>
Every one of them that I know <br>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs <br>
That'll never take work off <br>
Baby, I got a plan <br>
Run away fast as you can <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: Kanye West] <br>
She find pictures in my e-mail <br>
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick <br>
I don't know what it is with females <br>
But I'm not too good at that shit <br>
See, I could have me a good girl <br>
And still be addicted to them hoodrats <br>
And I just blame everything on you <br>
At least you know that's what I'm good at <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Kanye West] <br>
And I always find, yeah, I always find <br>
Yeah I always find something wrong <br>
You been putting up with my shit just way too long <br>
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most <br>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast <br>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags <br>
Let's have a toast for the assholes <br>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags <br>
Every one of them that I know <br>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs <br>
That'll never take work off <br>
Baby, I got a plan <br>
Run away fast as you can <br>
 <br>
[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James] <br>
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away <br>
Run away from me, baby <br>
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya) <br>
Run away <br>
When it starts to get crazy <br>
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya) <br>
Then, run away <br>
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can <br>
Run away from me, baby, run away <br>
Run away from me, baby <br>
(Look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at-look at ya) <br>
Run away <br>
When it starts to get crazy <br>
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya) <br>
Why can't she just, run away? <br>
Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2: Pusha T] <br>
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind <br>
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it <br>
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it <br>
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off <br>
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha <br>
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off <br>
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off <br>
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers <br>
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas <br>
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet <br>
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it <br>
You should leave if you can't accept the basics <br>
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix <br>
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless <br>
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P! <br>
 <br>
[Verse 3: Kanye West] <br>
Never was much of a romantic <br>
I could never take the intimacy <br>
And I know I did damage <br>
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me <br>
I guess you are at an advantage <br>
Cause you can blame me for everything <br>
And I don't know how I'ma manage <br>
If one day you just up and leave <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Kanye West] <br>
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong <br>
You been putting up with my shit just way too long <br>
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most <br>
So I think it's time for us to have a toast <br>
Let's have a toast for the douchebags <br>
Let's have a toast for the assholes <br>
Let's have a toast for the scumbags <br>
Every one of them that I know <br>
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs <br>
That'll never take work off <br>
Baby, I got a plan <br>
Run away fast as you can <br>
