        LYRICS:
        <p id="text">[Intro]<br>
          Say some more, never want to talk about it <br>
          Feel a way, woah <br>
          Feel a way, woah <br>
          Feel a way, November... <br>
             [Chorus] <br>
          Take me back to November <br>
          Take me back to November <br>
          Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water <br>
          Yeah, take me back to November, wassup <br>
          Can we go back to November? <br>
          Take me back to November <br>
          Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts <br>
          Naw, take me back to November, wassup <br>
          <br>
             [Verse 1]<br>
          What if Clancy fuckin' me over?<br>
          What if "Who Dat Boy" is rhetorical and this shit is over?<br>
          What if I'm hustling backwards?<br>
          What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?<br>
          Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions <br>
          I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics <br>
          Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics <br>
          What if my music too weird for the masses? <br>
          And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or <br>
          All my day ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven <br>
          Fuck, what if I get stuck?<br>
          What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty <br>
          What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera <br>
          At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America <br>
          Damn, I would be hurtin' <br>
          Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working <br>
          Last year in total, I put out two verses <br>
          But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect <br>
          Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy <br>
          Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock <br>
          When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him <br>
          They don't drive these cars so what's their ultimatum? <br>
          Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?<br>
          Mine was the summer '06, I remember the... (horn)<br>
          What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?<br>
          What if these deep thoughts was my last?<br>
          Let me pull over, quick!<br>
    <br>
             [Chorus]<br>
          And drive back to November <br>
          Take me back to November <br>
          Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water <br>
          Yeah, take me back to November, wassup <br>
          Can we go back to November?<br>
          Take me back to November <br>
          Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts <br>
          Naw, take me back to November, wassup <br>

             [Interlude: Jasper Dolphin, Taco, Kilo Kish, Christian Clancy,Syd, Lionel, Vince Staples, Julian Conesugra]<br>
          My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just <br>
          skate all day <br>
          My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me,<br>
          I think I cried that night <br>
          My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film <br>
          My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album <br>
          My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform <br>
          My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...<br>
          My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked <br>
          my whole world up, showed me life through a different <br>
          2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November <br>
    <br>
             [Bridge]<br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind <br>
          Time travel back and help me find <br>
          Take me back, take me back to November, this I know <br>
          Take me back, take me back <br>
          Take me back, take me back to November, this I know <br>
          "My November is right now"<br>
    <br>
             [Verse 2]<br>
          I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion <br>
          Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending <br>
          'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics are <br>
          Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it <br>
          If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts <br>
          Although I already know the response you gon' say back <br>
          At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back <br>
          And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback <br>
    <br>
             [Outro]<br>
          Hello, no one is available to take your call <br>
          Please leave a message after the tone <br>
          [beep]<br>
