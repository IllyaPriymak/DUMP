          [Intro: Kevin Abstract] <br>
I don't know where I'm goin' <br>
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin' <br>
 <br>
[Verse 1: Matt Champion] <br>
I ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta <br>
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house <br>
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy <br>
Lowly lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else <br>
Get nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin' <br>
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass <br>
Late night corner, we pass <br>
Lick that Swisher, get red <br>
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend <br>
We don't go there no more <br>
We don't see sun no more <br>
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI <br>
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye <br>
Everything 'cept the dog <br>
Everything in the drawers <br>
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion] <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help when my <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help when my <br>
 <br>
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood] <br>
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed <br>
More like God's special mess, never had no halo <br>
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed <br>
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in <br>
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options <br>
Mmm, options, used to have options <br>
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options <br>
Mmm, options, used to have options <br>
 <br>
[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract] <br>
I don't know where I'm goin' <br>
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin' <br>
I don't know where I'm goin' <br>
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin' <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion] <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help when my <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help when my <br>
 <br>
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon] <br>
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams <br>
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams <br>
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream <br>
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees <br>
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please <br>
But I believe to an extreme <br>
(That we all can find a way) <br>
To anybody listenin' that's in between <br>
(That we all can find a way) <br>
 <br>
[Verse 4: Joba] <br>
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit <br>
Been goin' through it again <br>
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am <br>
Been thinkin' I am better than Him <br>
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan <br>
Lost a part of me, but I am still here <br>
 <br>
[Bridge: bearface] <br>
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute) <br>
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go) <br>
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute) <br>
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go) <br>
 <br>
[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion] <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help me when my <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my eyes go red <br>
I'm sure I'll find it <br>
No one help me when my, no one help me when my <br>
